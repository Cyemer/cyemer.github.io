# Setting up Cyemer
Setting up Cyemer is incredibly easy, simply go [here](https://cyemer.github.io) and press download, then select your version. From there, drag the downloaded file into your mods folder. Remember to install the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for that version. 

!!! warning "Important"
    If you have the "Dynamic FPS" mod installed, Cyemer will **NOT** work. This is because it disguises itself as Dynamic FPS to hide in screenshares. This is the most common reason that Cyemer will not work. 

After launching your game, you may notice that the GUI does not scale on the screen correctly (some panels tabs may be cut off). To fix this, simply hold the control key and scroll out. You can also scroll back in. If the GUI is too far to one side, press in your middle mouse button and drag it around to move it.
